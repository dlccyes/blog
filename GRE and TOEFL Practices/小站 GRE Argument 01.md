**Woven baskets characterized by a particular distinctive pattern have previously been found only in the immediate vicinity of the prehistoric village of Palea and therefore were believed to have been made only by the Palean people. Recently, however, archaeologists discovered such a "Palean" basket in Lithos, an ancient village across the Brim River from Palea. The Brim River is very deep and broad, and so the ancient Paleans could have crossed it only by boat, and no Palean boats have been found. Thus it follows that the so-called Palean baskets were not uniquely Palean.**

**Write a response in which you discuss what specific evidence is needed to evaluate the argument and explain how the evidence would weaken or strengthen the argument.**

First, Palea is a prehistoric village. The Brim River may be very deep and broad now, but that does not mean that it has been like that since ancient times. It is very possible that the river was actually narrow and shallow during the era where the Palean people was active. Therefore, the author may need to include some scientific evidence showing that the river was deep and broad at that time.

Second, even if it can be proven that the Brim River was very deep and broad during prehistoric times, the author still need some geographical evidence to show that the other side of the river can only be reached through boats. Without those evidences, we can not reject the possibility of the Palean backet being transported via other ways, for example, from the very upstream of the river, where it was shallow or narrow enough to be crossed without a boat. It may be even from an accident, where a Palean person accidentally dropped a Palean backet into the river, which was later brought to the other side of the river through natural flow of water.

Third, let's say all the above logical holes are responded with strong evidence, no Palean boats being found still cannot prove that there were no Palean boats at the village across the river. Archaealogy can only prove something to have existed, but not something to not have existed. Maybe the boats were very far away from the village; maybe the boats were destroyed by either human or natural force; maybe the boats were there but just not be found yet. There are plenty of reasons for the boats to be missing, assuming the boats have existed.

The argument may be sounding at first glance, but there are actually quite a lot of logical holes to be fixed. The author should be advised to find more scientific, geographical and archaealogical evidence to support his argument, while the evidences may or may not end up weakening his original arguement.
