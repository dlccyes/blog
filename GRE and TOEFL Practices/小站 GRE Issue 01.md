**As people rely more and more on technology to solve problems, the ability of humans to think for themselves will surely deteriorate.**

**Write a response in which you discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with the statement and explain your reasoning for the position you take. In developing and supporting your position, you should consider ways in which the statement might or might not hold true and explain how these considerations shape your position.**

To some extent, I agree with the statement, but of course its more complex than a single answer, realistically speaking.

Why do I agree with this statement in some extent? With the Internet becomes more and more powerful and easily accessible, people tend to find the solution immediately when encountering a problem, while developing thoughts about solving a problem yourself is crucial for the a ability to think for yourself. When we rely on other's answer, instead of coming up one ourselves, we often just use the answer provided and don't think through everything. So when there is no answer, when you need to think for yourselves, you might not be able to do it very well.

That's not the full story, however. Before the age of information technology, information isn't that easy to get. To reference other's solution, you'll have to ask the people around you, and if they don't have the solution, you'll have to go to the library, go through so many books or thesis, just to find some lines of text that might or might not be helpful for your own problem. And because it's harder to get the information you want, you might have to spend quite a lot of efforts to come up with the solutions yourself. Therefore, people before the information age are not able to solve problems quickly.

People in the age of computer and the Internet, however, are able to solve problems very quickly, because of how easy, compared to 50 years ago, to get the information you want. And because people can solve problems with much less time and efforts by referencing others' works, they develop even more new technologies as well as research papers, resulting to more information that can be reference, leading to the exponential growth of the speed to solve a problem as well as the amount of problems solved. As we rely more and more on technology to solve problems, we may have spent less efforts on a problem, but we also solve much more problems than before, therefore, our problem solving skills, as well as the ability to think, in general, may also grow.

To sum up, I believe that, it's naive to generalize this question so much, thinking that the ability for all humans to think for themselves will either deteriorate or not because of the advancing technologies. Instead, we should look at it case by case. If a person utilize the new technologies to extend his or her knowledge based on others' works, in order to solve even more problems, then for this person, the ability to think for itself will surely become better. However, if a person only uses the Internet to search for quick answers for his or her homework or thesis, or even straight up copy pasting them, then the ability for this person to think for itself would probably deteriorate.
