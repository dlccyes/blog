The statement seems rather shallow. It does not define what the most important characteristics is, instead, the author just throw out a big word and expect everyone to understand what he or she is trying to say. As the statement is very obscure, I would tend to say, no, I do not agree with the statement.

Major cities are the face of a country, and are also the most advanced areas in probably every aspect of the country, including technology, education, medical resources, research power, etc. Hence, by inspecting the major cities of a country, you will get to know the highest height, the most advanced part of the country. For some people, that may be the most important characteristics of a society. However, I would argue that, you will miss a lot of characteristics that may not be less important if you only look at the major cities.

Major cities are composed of the richest people, those on the top of the social ladder. Young people also tend to be attracted by the big cities, as the career and other oppurtunities are far more prevalent there, compared to smaller cities or rural areas. Moreover, major cities are very globalized, As a result, major cities are always the most progressive are always riding at the tip of the technology wave, not missing any of the most recent progression of anything. But how about the oridinary people? Are normal people's lives and struggles not as important as those of the youngs or the elites? Are the culture of rural areas not counted as a characteristic of a country? Hardly. In my honest opinion, the lives and culture of the older generation or poorer people are just as valid. In fact, as the minor cities or the rural areas tend to be more traditional, the older culture of a society is best preserved there. 

Major cities are always chasing the latest trends, for fear of missing out, losing to the other part of the world. That may lead to progression, but the previous generation of culture is also lost in the process, though remaining to be an important characteristic of a society.

In short, as the author choose to make his or her statement pretty obscure, we can only guess the meaning behind it. But generally, I would disagree with the statement, as the culture outside of the major cities never less important than those of major cities.
