**In the past it was easier to identify what type of career or job would lead to a secure, successful future.**

Yes, I generally agree that it's easier to identify what type of career or job would lead to a secure and successful future in the past, however, that is not the whole story.

In the past, technology isn't advancing so fast, the society is therefore more stable than in current generation. As a result, the social status pyramid is more static, dream jobs are the same for almost everyone, as the highest paying jobs rarely changes. For example, doctors, engineers, professors, and maybe civil servants are always the most desirable jobs, as the pay is high, and you would be well respected if you're in those fields. And as the supply is much more than the demand of those jobs, those jobs remain prestigious, effectively forming a positive feedback loop. But how about the more mediocre jobs? In a static society, those mediocre jobs remain mediocre, which means that although the most successful and secure careers can be easily identified, if you're not able to be on those selected career paths, you'll probably be mediocre for a whole lifetime, with very little chance to perform an 180-degree turn and climb up to the peak of the social status pyramid.

In the current generation, with the ever-progressing information technology, the old and relatively static social pyramid is disrupted. Now, as long as you have a computer, a decent Internet connection and a flexible brain, willing to constantly learn new things in this ever-changing world, you can easily generate some side-income with maybe a blog, a youtube channel or some apps or web services. This provide so many more chances for people on a once considered mediocre career path, to climb up the social ladder, leading to a secure and successful career. On the other hand, this also make it harder to identify a career that would guarantee a secure and successful future. For example, a machine learning model developed by some random computer science student may proven to be effective in the medical field, thus reducing the demand of doctors, resulting in some reduction of their wage, possibly to an extent that some random Twitch streamers would earn more then them.

To sum up, I would agree that it's to foresee a successful career in the past, when the social pyramid is more static. In the current generation, it's harder to do that considering the speed of technology development in recent years, challenging the structure of society. However, it also provide more opportunities. There is much more way to be successful than it is in the past. Like most things in this world, when a door is closed, the other door is opened.
