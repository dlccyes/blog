**Imagine that you are in a classroom or a meeting. The teacher or the meeting leader says something incorrect. In your opinion, which of the following is the best thing to do?**

**1）Interrupt and correct the mistake right away**

**2）Wait until the class or meeting is over and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader**

**3）Say nothing**

The answer of the question largely depends on the actual scenario. In my opinion, all the three options are the best thing to do in certain scenarios, and I'll try to explain what kind of scenarios fit the 3 options respectively.

First, when should I interrupt and correct the mistake of the speaker right away? If the discussed matter is pretty important, and that I'm already very well-educated, or say, an expert, on the that topic, I would correct the mistake right after I spotted it. As the matter is important, the benefits it would do on all of the listeners would most certainly outweigh the negative impact of the embarrassment of the speaker caused by my interruption.

The above scenario, however, is pretty uncommon. As I am the listener, not the speaker, I probably know less than what the speaker do. Hence, even if I hear something that seems to be incorrect at first thought, it might proven to be actually correct after more information is given. Therefore, I would choose to wait until the event is over and discuss this matter with the speaker privately if I'm not really very well educated on the matter.

Finally, when is it best to say nothing? Throughout the lifetime, people usually say many unimportant stuffs, for the sole purpose of saying something, and that isn't limited to small talks. Often times, we'll find ourselves participating in classes, meetings or speeches that talk about everything but actual, useful or legit information that matters. In these cases, which happen quite a lot actually, there is absolutely no point to correct a mistake the speaker makes, as it doesn't matter at all.

Depending on the actual situation, what to do when encountering a mistake the speaker makes varies. In the above text, I provide the scenarios that would lead me to react in each of the three options, for the purpose of providing a bit more realism for this overly-simplified question.
