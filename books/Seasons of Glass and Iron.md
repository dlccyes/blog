Seasons of Glass and Iron

.....why

It's not a bad story or something. I kind of enjoy it. But it's just ...... that .... it's not insightful. It has no interesting techs or magics. It's ...... a fairy tale, about lifting each other's pseudo curse, escaping themselves' mindlock at wish.

..... so what

I see no reason of it getting a treble (Hugo, Nebula, Locus).

I just don't get it. I thought it would be a banger, seeing how many awards it got. But no.

Such a weird story, weird in an unneeded way. The weird settings of the story do not make it anymore insightful.

I hate to say this but .... his story isn't really a better awardee for the Hugo Award than John Chu's absolute "[The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere](The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere)" shit.

Awards are so fucking weird. This story isn't about representation or some SJW shit, nor is it about the traditional good fantasy/sci-fi things. Really just a fairy tale, very suitable to be presented as a picture book for 6yos or something.

plot:

A princess is so beautiful that everyone want to get her. The King could make prince from neighboring countries marry her, but the country is politically sensitive, can't 偏袒 either of the neighboring countries. So the princess and the King decided to lock her on a glass hill, and announced that any man that can go up the hill with full armor can marry her. 

But the glass hill is very weird, very hard to climb up, so the princess had lived on the hill for like 3 years, without facing cold or starvation or whatever because of the magic hill.

One day a woman accidentally walked up the hill. The woman was married to a bear, a half-bear half-man, sometimes a bear sometimes a man. And after they'd married, the bearman frequently abused her. One time she told her mom, her mom told her to burn his bear skin (which is separated when he's in man form???) to lift his curse. The bear found out, and told the women to wear his bear skin (?) and wear 7 iron shoes (one at a time of course) until they've all broken. This way his curse can be lifted.

......

Anyway, after spending some time together, and told each other their stories, both decided that the other did nothing wrong, and they decided to go away together to whatever place.

The End.

Gonna give it a 2/5, because I see no value in reading it, or the reason that this story should exist. 

But it's not 1/5 bad, I still get like 30 minutes of peaceful time in reading it.
