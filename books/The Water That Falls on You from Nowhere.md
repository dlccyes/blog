I must have read the wrong story.

How is this piece of shit award-worthy in any fucking way? The premise－water falls when you lie－has absolutely nothing to do with the fucking story. Moreover, the story is a garbage itself. Basically no plot, with very poor writing (not very fluent).

The plot:  
A gay couple decided to get marry, but one (the Chinese) hasn't come out to his family yet. So in the Christmas vacation, both go to his home, seeking opportunities to come out.

The Chinese's sister is a karen and try to stop him in any way, but they finally come out, just to find out his parents already knows, and are very acceptive of it.

The End.

..........

I see absolutely no value in this story at all.  

The three major settings  makes me think that, the story is specifically written and designed for getting Hugo award.

- [x] gay
- [x] Chinese
- [x] being oppressed

But wait Hugo is about speculative fictions! Well then, let's put in a random weird "magic" or whatever into the world! It's not like it has anything to do with the story, but it makes the story go from a BL (a very poor one, tho I've read none) to a speculative fiction! Hugo Award gets!
