# About this blog
## meta
This blog uses the Jekyll theme [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/), with some custom additions (like backlinks) and heavy CSS alterations, hosted with Github Page.

Locally, I edit these posts with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

The background image comes from [here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f6/20/a1/f620a179ca1acfd15a0754701677fb58.jpg)

which I dimmed and applied 15 pixels of gaussian blur, resulted in [this](https://i.imgur.com/C90lb3z.jpg)

About the icon (`<link rel="icon" href="https://i.imgur.com/mypR8sN.pngs">`). It has no meaning at all. It's just the icon I used when trying to get my little [Spotify playlist stats visualizer](https://playlastify.herokuapp.com/) through Spotify's quota extension (so that everyone logging in can use the API, not only myself). I initially used a stylized Spotify icon I randomly found on Google images, but Spotify said it's a branding violation, and I thought a website without an icon is kind of lame, so I just opened [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), drew some random circles, and called it an icon. Surprisingly, it looks kind of nice.

## contents
The contents of this blog mainly comes from what I've written privately in my own notebook (Evernote) throughout the years. But I may also write new things when I feel like it.
