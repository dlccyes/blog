# 2021.10.05 vegans
[r/vegancirclejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegancirclejerk/) is fun

But there are dumb people everywhere.

Some vegans unironically jerk to the idea that when non-vegans are arguing that vegans are not cruelty-free, they're suddenly advocating for animal rights.
What kind of logic is that? They are not fucking advocating for animal rights, they are explaining to you that your lifestyle is not as cruelty-free as what you claimed.

And the honey things also. Don't think honey is that cruel. Might be just as about killing insects and small animals with pesticides, yet vegans act like it's such a big thing, that if you consume honey you're morally bad, while vegans are not cruelty-free either.

But it's fun to watch vegans trashing vegetarians whatsoever.
