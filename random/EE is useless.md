# EE is useless
EE is not useless, I am.

As an average EE student, I learned nothing throughout the first 2 years of college. If I want to intern, I'll have exactly nothing to provide, unless some random companies would want you to calculate the overall gain of a simple microelectronics circuit by hand (fx-991, I mean) for some reason. CS students, on the other hand, are probably already capable of handling some complex tasks engineers would encounter in a software company, even if they only come from an average school. You can also see that from the qualifications of intern. For hardware jobs, they often require you to be pursuing a Master's degree or at least in the final year of college, but for software jobs, not so much. They'll accept you as long as you're familiar with the language and the infrastructure, or not, if you're smart and can pick up skills fast enough. Or that you can leetcode very well.

Not to mention the compulsory courses of EE are all boring af

That's why I'm very happy when I got into a no-name web service company as an intern before I became a junior, although other CS majors may have gone into FAANG(or MAMAA), some shiny unicorns, or even HFTs.
