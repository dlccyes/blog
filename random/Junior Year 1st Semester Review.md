# Junior Year 1st Semester Review
{: .no_toc }

Normally, the sophomore year is the busiest year of NTUEE, but I'm actually more busy this semester.

Last semester is the hardest semester of the first 4 semesters of mine, but I still managed to go to both Taekwondo club and Judo club (and the football team of our department of course). However, in the bottom half of this semester, I only managed to go to a total of 1 time to Taekwondo club and Judo club (still played football week-in-week-out tho).

Before, I could spent all my time not doing coursework related things on extracurricular activities, but this semester, I also had to do what my boss from my internship wanted me to do and some internship preparations, like writing resume, cover letters and leetcoding, and these things took a lot of my time. Actually, during final exam weeks, the subject I'd spent most time on, is leetcode.

About the courses I took, they're generally much easier and funner than the mandatory courses in the first two years. Therefore, even though I wan't less busy than before, I'm definitely much happier.

Below I'll write some thoughts about the courses I took.

## Spanish (â…¡)(1)

## General Psychology

## Macroeconomics (1)

## Introduction to Computer Networks

## Algorithms
The loading of this course isn't nearly as hard as what it's said to be, because the homework seemed to be only half of the previous years. It isn't really difficult too. I barely payed attention in class, but when I was doing homework, I can get familiar with the concept and techniques by reading some online articles. 

The exams are really easy also, the average score was like 70+, while mandatory courses before like Microelectronics and Electromagnetism have average score of 50 or so.

Programming assignment tho, is hard to say. There are 3 PAs. The first one is merely implementing basic sorting algorithms. The second is a LC medium level dp problem, but it requires some very great optimization, because the largest test case is super large (n=18k while the algo is O(n^2)), and you have to run it in under 10 min. to get credit. And time is not the only problem. Space complexity is also O(n^2), and you'll have to squeeze it very hard to make it not using all the memory on the workstation. The third is a graph problem, the goal is to make the given graph acyclic by breaking edges with min total weight of edges broke, and for weighted directed graph, it's NP-hard, so the grading for that case is by what min weight you achieve in efficient time.

Overall, it's definitely not the hardest nor the heaviest course I've ever taken, not even among the courses I took this semester.
