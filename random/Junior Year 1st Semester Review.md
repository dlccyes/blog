# Junior Year 1st Semester Review
{: .no_toc }

Normally, the sophomore year is the busiest year of NTUEE, but I'm actually more busy this semester.

Last semester is the hardest semester of the first 4 semesters of mine, but I still managed to go to both Taekwondo club and Judo club (and the football team of our department of course). However, in the bottom half of this semester, I only managed to go to a total of 1 time to Taekwondo club and Judo club (still played football week-in-week-out tho).

Before, I could spent all my time not doing coursework related things on extracurricular activities, but this semester, I also had to do what my boss from my internship wanted me to do and some internship preparations, like writing resume, cover letters and leetcoding, and these things took a lot of my time. Actually, during final exam weeks, the subject I'd spent most time on, is leetcode.

About the courses I took, they're generally much easier and funner than the mandatory courses in the first two years. Therefore, even though I wan't less busy than before, I'm definitely much happier.

Below I'll write some thoughts about the courses I took.
