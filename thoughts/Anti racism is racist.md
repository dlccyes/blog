# Anti racism is racist
![](https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/25/O2PgfVI7qGiUL9W.jpg)

This is why I hate those "anti racism" "fair" movement. **IT'S NOT.** Doing that kinds of shit **IS** racism itself, and it is not **FAIR** at all.

Just fucking stop it.

I do support 保障名額 in politics, because politicians should represent people. If some demographics are underrepresented, then the law should make them be well-represented. But company? NO PLZ

Treating minor races or sex differently isn't the way to eliminate racism or sexist from this world. Being fair is.

By fair, you treat every race or sex as if they have no difference. Somebody might say but but but women are physically weaker than men.

**NO**

**THEY'RE NOT**

**SOME** of them are

So, if you want to people with different physical abilities differently, then fucking do so. Separate people with strengths, not sex, and you might say but but but some races don't have enough learning sources, so they should have bonus points.

**NO**

Give bonus points to those with less learning sources, not the whole race.

Is that so hard?

Yeah maybe. Treating the whole race or sex differently is easier. But then it's can't be called fair. It's trying to be fair but only get it half done because of laziness.
