# Best Note-Taking Services 2021

## Obsidian

## Evernote Legacy
Evernote v10 is shit, but Evernote legacy still holds up. Despite its dated UIs, it remains solid and powerful. The best all-around note-taking service on the market, I would say. 

What makes Evernote standout isn't the note-taking features itself, but the ecosystem. Evernote is available on almost all platforms, including native apps on Windows, MacOs, Android, iOS, and a web version. The desktop app is the most powerful, providing incredible features like imported folders, and a databse like UX. You can sort your notes in many ways, and search them with various filters. None of the other services provide them. And the note-taking itself is also pretty solid. It may not have shiny new features like backlinks or block references,  nor does it support markdown, but the WYGIWYS is pretty comfy and support many things that markdown don't, for example, coloring your text, highlight or tables (unless you hardcode in html ofc). The way it handle image is also very satifying. When you double click the image, it opens in fullscreen, and you can zoom in, switch to another image, or even do some editing, which again, is the feature that none of the shiny markdown editors provide.
