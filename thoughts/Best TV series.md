## Gold
### Black Mirror

### House of Cards

### Yes (Prime) Minister
A political satire sitcom by BBC in 1980s, still beats every sitcom nowadays by a huge margin. 

Despite the fake laughs, the script is just so well written. Every joke is golden, funny in a witty way, typical British humor, unlike the it is funny because it is funny kind of American humor.

This show was consists of 2 series, Yes Minister & Yes Prime Minister, each 
with 2-3 seasons, and the only bad episode is the finale of Yes Minister. That episode was to act out how the protagonist became the prime minister, so it was 90% plot-focused, and the result is that all the witty jokes are .... not gone, but greatly reduced, as the main focus was not the satires, but the plot, in that very episode. Other than that, every episode is golden.

I've watched some popular modern (political or not) sitcoms, like The Office, The Thick of It and Veep, and none matched the height of it.
