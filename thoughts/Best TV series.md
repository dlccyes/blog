## Gold
### Black Mirror

### House of Cards

### Yes (Prime) Minister
A political satire sitcom by BBC in 1980s, still beats every sitcom nowadays by a huge margin. 

Despite the fake laughs, the script is just so well written. Every joke is golden, funny in a witty way, typical British humor, unlike the it is funny because it is funny kind of American humor.

This show was consists of 2 series, Yes Minister & Yes Prime Minister, each 
with 2-3 seasons, and the only bad episode is the finale of Yes Minister. That episode was to act out how the protagonist became the prime minister, so it was 90% plot-focused, and the result is that all the witty jokes are .... not gone, but greatly reduced, as the main focus was not the satires, but the plot, in that very episode. Other than that, every episode is golden.

I've watched some popular modern (political or not) sitcoms, like The Office, The Thick of It and Veep, and none matched the height of it.

## Silver
### Mindhunter

### The Thick of It

### Money Heist

### Westworld

### Monty Python

## Honorable Mentions
### The 100
This show is a fucking joke. It's a sci-fi, and the drama part of the show is pretty decent, but the science part ....... not even the level of elementary science. Just to give some example, the space station in the show can generate gravity without spinning, the gravity is gone once the air is out, you can do hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at will without considering rejection, doing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation would cause the donator to die, and many more.

Pretty much like this

Not sure if the show really didn't have at least one people with junior-high level of scientific knowledge, but they really just designed the science part whatever they wanted, whatever was cool or suited the plot. Too fucking lazy.

As of the drama part, it gives me some good times. I kind of trashed it while binge watching at the same time because of how trash the science is and how addictive the plot is.

I only decided to stop at the first episode of Season 5, where they introduced another retard sci-fi setting. They just wanted to put every single sci-fi & apocalypse element into the show. A joke.

I'm not anti-LGBTQ or anything but the woke people are really dumb. They do not think with their head. In Season 3, a lesbian main character was killed (in a pretty dumb way). And then the IMDb rating of that episode was bombed. The most interesting part is that, you can clearly that those 1-star reviews are only from young (woke) girls

It's hilarious. And many of those reviews focused on the lesbian part, they thought that she was killed because of some kind of anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda, while in reality she was killed because the actress's role in another show. 

> Lesbian characters get killed. LGBT+ characters get killed. It's a trope that stems from the 1950's, when it was a way to transfer a message, the message that being gay is unhealthy, and following that path will end in unhappiness. Lexa isn't the first lesbian character to die, she's not even the first to get shot - she's not even the first to get hit with a bullet by accident.

And the 1-star-review bomb spanned for a few episodes, even in a episode that was actually strong.

Anyways, shit show, shitty fans.

Season ratings:  
Season 2 (very good, science sucks) > Season 1 (good) >> Season 3 (laughable, science sucks) â‰ˆ Season 4 (science sucks)

Season 3 & 4 do have their moments, but overall, they suck.

### Silicon Valley
Silicon Valley gave me some knowledge about the software industry in the US, in an easily-consumable way. That's all. The comedy itself isn't really good. Not really funny most of the time.

### The Office
The show that everyone loves, the show that many people regard as part of their personality.

For S1~S4, it is sometimes a hit, sometimes a miss, sometimes just mediocre. Not so special to me really. I mean, this way humor is presented is pretty special, and I can see the influence in so many places, but it's not always funny.

As for S5, the first half is sublime. The director or script writer or whatever had definitely changed. The humor was more real and more dark. But the second half, it changed to the typical American comedy, where humor is funny (they aren't actually) in a very straightforward way, the exact opposite of British humor. And at S6E1, it reached a new height, where every single humor is literal. So I decided to stop watching it. The last thing I need is need another retard Murican comedy.

### Veep
