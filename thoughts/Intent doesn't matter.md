# Intent doesn't matter

"What a beautiful piece of work! It perfectly conveys my ideology!"  
*discover that the author supports the opposite ideology   
"What an absolute piece of garbage! This trash has no value at all!"

Why the fuck would you care about the author's intent?  What you get from the text shouldn't be affected by what the author is trying to say.
You're not reading the author's mind, you're reading his text, and you didn't read it for the author, you read it to get something out of it, and if the transphobic racist sexist (animephobic) Nazi author's passage can inspire something out of you, then so be it. You get something, you win.

It's like, denying Hitler's art or denying everything Hitler because he ordered to kill a lot of Jews.
