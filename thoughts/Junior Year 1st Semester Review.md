# Junior Year 1st Semester Review
{: .no_toc }

Normally, the sophomore year is the busiest year of NTUEE, but I'm actually more busy this semester.

Last semester is the hardest semester of the first 4 semesters of mine, but I still managed to go to both Taekwondo club and Judo club (and the football team of our department of course). However, in the bottom half of this semester, I only managed to go to a total of 1 time to Taekwondo club and Judo club (still played football week-in-week-out tho).

Before, I could spent all my time not doing coursework related things on extracurricular activities, but this semester, I also had to do what my boss from my internship wanted me to do and some internship preparations, like writing resume, cover letters and leetcoding, and these things took a lot of my time. Actually, during final exam weeks, the subject I'd spent most time on, is leetcode.

About the courses I took, they're generally much easier and funner than the mandatory courses in the first two years. Therefore, even though I wan't less busy than before, I'm definitely much happier.

Below I'll write some thoughts about the courses I took. Note that they are not in any way intended to be helpful. I just write what I want.

## Spanish (â…¡)(1)

## General Psychology
I always want to took this course, but the class I was in is a little bit different. The professor is not that conventional. He opened this class for everyone to enroll, because he expected Covid to become serious again and then every course would be forced to go full online anyway (spoilers: it did not). He offered 2 options for grading, first is class participation + wikibook edits, second is a final exam.

The wikibook edits option is really easy. Each submission would earn you 0/5/10 points, so you'll just have to submit 9 times (if it gets full score) to have A+. The target of edit is the wikibook project the professor had done in his previous version of classes. It's a compilation of many wikibook articles written by his students, called [Super General Psychology](https://zh.wikibooks.org/zh-tw/%E8%B6%85%E6%99%AE%E9%80%9A%E5%BF%83%E7%90%86%E5%AD%A6) . All the contents have already been written, so what we have to do is to edit them to achieve better quality, either in terms of contents or visual. 
At first glance, it is a pretty cool and meaningful thing, but actually, the wikibook articles written by his students, are very very bad. They are all extremely verbose, repetitive, and contains many unreliable sources. It is the result of the previous version of grading. In his previous version of classes, the score you get on each edit is solely determined by the insertion count. Therefore, the more text you copy paste from trash resources, the higher grade you got. The professor noticed it, so he change the scoring method from quantitative to qualitative. The score you got for each submission was now decided by the TAs. And they encourage you to not insert new text, but edit previous contents and visuals. Unfortunately, that wan't nearly enough to save it. There is just too much garbage in each wikibook article. I doubt anyone can really get useful information from reading the wikibook. 
The score is super easy to get tho. I spent like 1 hour on each submission, and I overachieved on all of them. The full mark in 10 points, but I feel like each of my submission worth 20 points. I never actually read the contents, I only focus on the UI UX part, like adding links, formatting tables, changing punctuation marks form half-width to full-width, inserting [the space of pangu](https://github.com/vinta/pangu.js) etc.
As of the actual course, it's pretty fun. The professor was a math graduate, so he won't talk about those retard part of psychology, but the more scientific portion. Actually, psychology is more like the physiology of brain. The professor is a pretty good lecturer, and I did learn something. Unfortunately, I was just too busy on other things toward the end of the semester, so I only watched like 2/3 of less of his lecture videos. I mean, I could actually not watch any of the course video and still get A+ by editing wikibook, so .......


## Macroeconomics (1)
The professor, Ching-Sheng Mao, is of New Classical School, and it's actually not much different from microeconomics. All the methods of analysis, like budget line, indifference curve, utility function, edgeworth box etc. are same. I thought I would know better about the differentiation between micro & macro-economics after I took macroeconomics, but actually, I do no know what the differences are now. That's probably natural, given the fact that there is no differentiation between the two in Adam Smith's Classical world. Rationality & equilibrium, these are the two things to solve everything.

I have friends that goes to the class with a Keynesian professor, and Keynesian economics seems to have many weird formulas coming out of nowhere. Not the case in my class at all. All the formulas taught in this course are derived from simple and easily-understandable concepts.

Mr. Mao is a really fun person. He likes to criticize people or politics in a really funny but sensible way, backed with the analysis he did on the blackboard. He also thinks having exams is a waste of resources, so sometimes he'll come up with some unexpected changes of grading. For example, several years ago, on the very day of the final exam, he suddenly announced that there would be no exam. It sounded ridiculous at first, but he only kept the exam to make students study, and since before the actual exam day, every student expect there would be a final exam, they would study, so really having the final exam or not did not matter anymore as the goal (to make student study) had been achieved already. But of course, just as increasing inflation rate to achieve less unemployment rate, it only works when the change is unexpected, so Mr. Mao never did it again in later years. However, on the day of our final exam, he did the trick again, with some variations. He announced you can opt to use your adjusted midterm exam score * 0.9 as the overall grade, instead of the original midterm + final / 2. Which means that, if your adjusted midterm exam score is over 94 or so, you're automatically A+ if you took the option and not took the final exam.
So, those high-performing students scoring high in midterm, which is of quite a number, really just walked out. Unfortunately, I fucked up in a GDP calculation problem and lost a standard variation of score in that problem in midterm, so I was not one of them. Fuck GDP 

## Introduction to Computer Networks

## Algorithms
The loading of this course isn't nearly as hard as what it's said to be, because the homework seemed to be only half of the previous years. It isn't really difficult too. I barely payed attention in class, but when I was doing homework, I can get familiar with the concept and techniques by reading some online articles. 

The exams are really easy also, the average score was like 70+, while mandatory courses before like Microelectronics and Electromagnetism have average score of 50 or so.

Programming assignment tho, is hard to say. There are 3 PAs. The first one is merely implementing basic sorting algorithms. The second is a LC medium level dp problem, but it requires some very great optimization, because the largest test case is super large (n=18k while the algo is O(n^2)), and you have to run it in under 10 min. to get credit. And time is not the only problem. Space complexity is also O(n^2), and you'll have to squeeze it very hard to make it not using all the memory on the workstation. The third is a graph problem, the goal is to make the given graph acyclic by breaking edges with min total weight of edges broke, and for weighted directed graph, it's NP-hard, so the grading for that case is by what min weight you achieve in efficient time.

Overall, it's definitely not the hardest nor the heaviest course I've ever taken, not even among the courses I took this semester, even though I expected it to be.
