# "Racist" is overused
I really think the term "racist" or other kinds of "XXXist" is over explained, in an extreme extent.

Like, it's nothing but truth that black's crime rate - subtracting those unfair judgement cases - is greater than that of whites.

So, when you met a black, one that you don't previously have any information about other than his appearance, of course he is more dangerous than a white stranger. And it's not racist to be like that, it's called using your brain.

What is racist, technically, then?

You treat two people differently, despite them having the exact same attributes, except race, that is called racist.

You met a black stranger and a white stranger and have different judgement at the first glance - not racist or any sort of bias.
