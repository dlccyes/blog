# Simulations? Why not?
Just had a mind-blowing thought.

What's the bad if we all just live inside simulations?

If we can all select what kind of person (including personality, talents, IQ, face, social status or whatever) we want to be and live in that simulation, why don't we?

"But that's not real!"

So what is real? Your rich father? Your pretty face? Your desirable born personality? It's all the same. Whether it's the you in the "real" world, or the 99.9999999% lifelike virtual simulations. If simulations can make everyone happy, why live in the real world?

Yeah you're successful. You have a girlfriend, have many friends, goes to a top university, is the core of your department, have good grades. But there're always people that are more successful than you. If you can not only have those mentioned above, but also always got GPA 4.3 without real hardworking, get Google's desirable offer before even graduated, and have tons of abilities that you didn't have, why not when there's no consequences at all? 

IF the technology exists of course.

If that exists, and you'll never have to go back to "reality",  I would definitely opt in, because why not? I'll be able to design my personalities and face and abilities and more. How desirable is that? And others in my world is just 99.99999999% lifelike AIs. Why not?

tl;dr

I need a girlfriend
